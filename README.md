==============

You can't be in touch with a friend all the time That's why there are social networks. Now there are too many! You don't have that much time to go through all those feeds, tweets, etc.. But you want to know what your friend is up to, what's she feeling like, is she OK, etc. The Pointed Circle helps you understand your friend's mood and sentiments over a recent period of time based on status updates, streams, photos, tweets, etc. Loosely based on Plutchikâ€™s Emotion Circumplex and heavily inspired by github data hack to understand sentiment, mood and the intensity of the moods based many social updates. Collating them, parsing, analyzing them to get a view of what is happening with the person.
